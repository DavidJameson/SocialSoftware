MAMP needs to be installed, presumably by CTS
Go to http://mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html if you are installing it yourself
Suggestion - once you have it up and running, consider changing the root folder for documents to a location outside the MAMP system and then add that location to version control.

Komodo IDE 8 needs to be installed, presumably by CTS

Once you have MAMP installed, create a simple php page called phpinfo.php (say) with the following contents
<?php
   echo phpinfo();
?>
and install it in your root documents folder. Test it using the URL
http://localhost:8888/phpinfo.php





Remote debugging.
Komodo IDE can debug PHP code running on a remote (i.e. MAMP) server but it requires a debugging library to be installed. 
You need to know which version of PHP you are running. You can find this by clicking on the Preferences... button in the MAMP dialog
and then click on PHP. As of this writing, PHP 5.5.3 is the default.

Go to http://code.activestate.com/komodo/remotedebugging/ to download the appropriate library 
(presumably the Mac OS X (universal) library for PHP Remote Debugging Client)
Expand the zip file and under the folder called 5.5 you will find a file called xdebug.so.

Then follow the instructions at the following URL to configure MAMP for remote debugging
http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/8.0/debugphp.html#remote_debug_PHP


You will be adding the following section to the php.ini file. That file is located at
/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/conf/php.ini

To debug a script, add the following name/value pair to the URL
   XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1

Use a ? before it if it's the first (or only) parameter after the URL, otherwise separate it from the 
previous parameter in the usual manner using &
