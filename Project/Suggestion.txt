In your function that is supposed to upload an image file, consider the following suggestions


1) Rename it to    uploadImageFile     since it's only good for uploading image files!

2) Take the entire section

	$allowedExts = array("gif", "jpeg", "jpg", "png","JPG");
	$temp = explode(".", $file["name"]);
	$extension = end($temp);
	if ((($file["type"] == "image/gif")
		|| ($file["type"] == "image/jpeg")
		|| ($file["type"] == "image/jpg")
		|| ($file["type"] == "image/pjpeg")
		|| ($file["type"] == "image/x-png")
		|| ($file["type"] == "image/png"))
		&& ($file["size"] < $size_limit)
		&& in_array($extension, $allowedExts))

out of the function and create a separate function called (for example)
   IsImageFile($file)
so that you can just write

   if (IsImageFile($file) ) ....


3) Change the ordering of the next section so that you check to see if the error is actually 0 in which case the THEN part will have the actual code for uploading...
